		<h2>iPod Collection</h2>

		<div id="content">
			<p> I really love iPods, they're really cool devices and I use a couple of them to listen to my music library when I'm on the go. Also since they are cheap I've gathered quite a few over the years. Here is my collection: </p>
			<br />

			<p> iPod Classics are my main focus. I think they are the coolest from the bunch (my favourite being the 3rd Gen). </p>
			<p> Here is my daily driver iPod - a 40 GB 3rd Generation. As with all of my other 3rd Gens, I got it untested and found out all it needed was a new battery, which I bought and replaced the old one with. </p>
