			<p> I got this machine for around 30 euros in 2021 as untested. It didn't show any signs of life with or without the charger. 
			Turns out these PowerBooks sometimes have problems with the DC-In board. 
			I confirmed that mine was dead because it wouldn't charge the battery and when I put a charged one it booted up. 
			The HDD was wiped so I got my Tiger DVD and put it in the Super Drive. 
			It made really bad grinding noises and would not read the disc so I used an external drive to install the OS. I also found out the right USB port didn't work. 
			I decided to see what was happening so I removed the Super Drive and the USB board. 
			Removing the black case revealed that the PRAM battery was swollen. I removed it, put everything back together and the USB port was working again. 
			That also fixed my Super Drive which also works perfectly now. I replaced the DC-In board with the one from my 2003 17" PowerBook and now it works perfectly. 
			For some reason the OS always crashed on boot and I found out it was caused by the AirPort Extreme card. 
			I'm not sure if it's a problem with the card or the motherboard because I haven't tested another one yet but unplugging it fixed my issue. 
			When the OS finally worked I noticed that the screen was showing artifacts, either a problem with the cable or the panel. 
			I confirmed it wasn't the GPU by plugging in an external monitor. 
			Up until recently the machine was working perfectly fine but started freezing for some reason. It also started reporting 1 GB instead of 1.5. 
			After that it wouldn't boot at all with the 512 stick. I tried another known working but it still would not boot. 
			I presume what happened was that the stick killed the whole slot so now the machine is stuck at 1 GB. 
			If someone knows how to fix it please get in contact with me. 
			Also the website banner is of this machine. </p>
