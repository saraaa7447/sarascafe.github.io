			<p> So, this one has a bit of a funny story. I found someone selling it online for around 150 euros and perfectly working but when I went to buy it they said that they had tried it and it refused to turn on.
 I asked if I could have it for 50 and they agreed and even added a gift - another 17" MacBook Pro (yeah). So I got a pretty sweet deal out of it. Now for the issues... These machines have defective GPUs and this one is no different.
It makes it so that after the machine heats up and you shut it down for any reason, it will not turn back on again. When you press the power button, you can hear the optical drive initialising, the fans and HDD spinning but that's it. No chime or anything on the screen. The only other indicator you get is
the sleep light being constantly on. Now, I found a trick to temporary revive it - leave it on like that with the lid closed, upside down and put it under covers or pillows for around 30-60 mins so that it gets really hot to the touch. After that turn it off and leave it to cool down for another hour.
This is how I fixed mine and it works now but it is only a temporary solution. The proper solution is to replace the GPU with the revised one that does not have these problems which I am planning to do in the future. </p>
			<p> This machine is also configured with the HI-RES screen which is 1920x1200. </p>
			<p> I also upgraded the 120 GB HDD it had to an SSD and have installed Mac OS Mojave on it. </p>
			<p> Update: It is now dead after I gave it to a repair shop to replace the GPU. They told me that the logic board started expanding when they removed the faulty chip. </p>
