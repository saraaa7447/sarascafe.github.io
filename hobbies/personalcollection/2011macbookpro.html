			<p> Got this locally for really cheap, untested. Seller had no idea if it worked because he didn't have a charger. Honestly I was expecting it to be dead. Surprisingly when I plugged it in, it started right up, I heard the chime, optical drive and then.... the display was completely destroyed. I was kinda surprised because the glass wasn't cracked or anything. The backside had a small dent but it wasn't where the centre of the damage was. The LCD has now been replaced, unfortunately I didn't take pictures before I did. Started it up and it works perfectly. Well, almost - there is another issue. Only the right side of the trackpad works for some reason. I suspected the battery might have started expanding but when I opened it up it look fine. Also the battery still holds a charge even though it probably was flat dead for months. Decided to remove the battery, which was a bit of a pain because of the screws Apple used but I got it eventually. Underneath I saw my issue. Turns out the trackpad cable had come loose on one side. I reseated it and thankfully it works perfectly now. I got High Sierra on it and it's really fast, as fast as my 2008 Mac Pro apparently. I'm currently typing this on it. </p>
			<p> 28/09/2023 - Upgraded the RAM from 4 to 8, using the sticks from the 17" 2011. </p>
			<p> 21/10/2023 - Cleaned and repasted the computer. It now runs ~10 degrees cooler. </p>
