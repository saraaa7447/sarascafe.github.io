			<p> I've always wanted a late G3 iBook since they went up all the way to 900 MHz, the fastest G3 Macs Apple has officially released. One day I decided to check my usual sites for second hand stuff and I found this one. It didn't say which model it was or what the specifications are but I noticed the "iBook" text below the screen used the new Myriad Pro font instead of Apple Garamond. They made this change in Late 2002, meaning this would be a 700 MHz model at the very least and 900 if I got lucky. Another thing they did was that they changed the case from being translucent to opaque white. I couldn't see make out which one this was from the pictures but when I got it, it was translucent, so I crossed out the 900 MHz model. Opening the keyboard revealed it was an 800 MHz model which is good because this is actually the exact one I wanted. Powering it on , the first thing that happened was the HDD started making loud and horrible noises that actually gave me a fright. Safe to say that it's dead, otherwise everything else works and the machine is in great condition. </p>
