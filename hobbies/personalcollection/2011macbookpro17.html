			<p> I got this machine for cheap just out of curiosity. I am well aware that this is the infamous model that suffers from GPU failures but for the price I thought it was worth it. The seller said that there was a problem with the battery but other than that said everything else works. When I got it, I plugged it with the charger that came with it but it didn't do anything so I got my other one. It instantly turned on to a Windows 7 install, so thankfully it was just the charger that was faulty. I upgraded it from the original 750 GB HDD to a 250 GB SSD and put 8 GB of RAM. My OS of choice was High Sierra as it's the last one officially supported and had drivers for the Radeon. I charged it up and used it for a day and that's when I realised the battery was draining really slowly. I installed coconutBattery and it showed that it could charge to 92.2% of the original capacity which means it was in really good condition. The whole machine visually is great, there's almost no cosmetic damage. It's also extremely fast, this makes it my second fastest Mac, twice as fast as my single-CPU 2008 Mac Pro, and slower than my M1 MacBook Pro. The Radeon works perfectly but I try to not use it often. It also has the optional faster i7 processor and the anti-glare screen. The only thing I am disappointed is the speakers - they are worse than my pre-Unibody 17" MacBook Pros which is a shame. </p>
