		<h2>Fix Discord for Mac OS 10.13 and 10.14</h2>
		</div>
		<div id="content">
			<p>This tutorial works for Discord Stable, PTB, Canary and for older versions of Mac OS as long as you have/know the last supported version! <br />
			<br />
			Yesterday, on Jan 22 2024, my Discord Canary updated to the newest version - 0.0.396 which is no longer compatible with my Mac OS version and requires 10.15 Catalina. <br />
			<br />
			Of course, I can always use the web version instead but the app is more handy so I found a way to keep it working. <br />
			<br />
			First if your Discord app has already updated and won't open, you'll need to remove it and its data using another application called "AppCleaner" which is free. I have provided links directly to Discord's official website for working versions of each client build which you can find below this. Use them to install the client.

				<a href="https://dl-ptb.discordapp.net/apps/osx/0.0.100/DiscordPTB.dmg" target="_blank"><button type="button">DiscordPTB<br /><small>0.0.100</small></button></a>
				<a href="https://dl-canary.discordapp.net/apps/osx/0.0.394/DiscordCanary.dmg" target="_blank"><button type="button">Discord Canary<br /><small>0.0.394</small></button></a></center>
			<p>
			Move the application to the App folder. Now, for the next part you'll need to disconnect your Mac from the internet. <br />
			<br />
			Open the app so it creates the necessary files and then when it fails to update - quit it. <br />
			<br />
			After this in a Finder window press Command + Shift + G and type "~/Library/Application Support/" then press Enter. Look for and open the appropriate folder (discord, discordptb, discordcanary).Open settings.json with Text Edit and add "SKIP_HOST_UPDATE": true at the end before the final closing bracket like in the image attached below. Don't forget to add a comma before it. This disables the auto updater. <br />
			<br />
			And that's it! I basically tried a bunch of different stuff hastily and it worked in the end so I'm not complaining.</p>
