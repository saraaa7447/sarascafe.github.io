			<p> Hello! I'm Sara. I collect hobbies like they're Pokemon cards, some of them include retro & modern computing, photography, drawing, coding and a lot more. Mostly I love to tinker around with computers - hardware and software. I take obsolete or broken devices, repair them and try to make them as usable as possible for modern tasks. Sometimes I also write small programs or scripts and also do software archival.</p>
			<p> P.S. I used to go by Scarlett7447/ScarlettPPC so if you see old stuff with that name it's probably mine. </p>

			<h3 class="special"> A bit more backstory about me </h3>
			Ever since I was little I was fascinated with technology, mostly tinkering with Soviet tech we had around the house as early in my life as I can remember. After that my family got a laptop when I was 5 and that was my first experience with a computer. Safe to say, showing interest would be a huge understatement. After that I was tinkering as much as I could - I remember that I really loved messing around with virtual machines when I was a kid. Learning Commodore Basic as well as other languages like Pascal. I've always shown a big interest in retro tech and have wanted to collect it. In around 2020 I started just that - collecting various obsolete tech like computers, film cameras, radios, televisions, phones, typewriters and more. I also started learning to code on more popular languages like C, C++ and C#. In 2022 I made my first website and what you are seeing right now is a redesign and improvement (at least in my eyes) of it. I have graduated a programming course on C# and ASP.NET and can develop web apps. I also have some experience with Python. I tinker with Unix OSes as well. I have a lot of experience managing Linux especially as it is my daily driver, along with various versions of Mac OS.
