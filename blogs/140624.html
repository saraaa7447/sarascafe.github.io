		<h2>14/06/2024 - New Website!</h2>
		</div>
		<div id="content">
			<p> As you may have noticed I redesigned my site! While the old one was functional and looked alright, I felt it was lacking and that I could do more than that. Also I didn't like how some stuff was structured so I decided to just start from scratch and just took the index page from the last one and built everything else from it. </p>
			<h3 class="special"> Some changes between the old and new site: </h3>
			<p> Since everything is in HTML and CSS, the old site looks bad on big screens so I decided to make the content a fixed size, so it stays more properly in the center. </p>
			<center><img src="old.png" width="490" alt="Old index page" /><img src="new.png" width="490" alt="New index page" /></center>
			<p> I also revamped the index page and added web buttons to other people's sites (cause buttons are cool). I also thought it was the perfect time to make my own button! You can see it on the index page or the "Art". </p>
			<p> Speaking of that, I changed the layout a bit, now my hobbies are... well, under the "My Hobbies" page. I wanted to keep the main navigation bar clean and since I have a lot of hobbies (with the very probable possibility of more popping up in the future) and having a different hyperlink for each would make the navbar way too long. 
 </p>
			<p> I also made the contacts page into the "About Me" page cause I wanted to talk a bit about myself, you know, the person that made this site and not be some mysterious figure behind this (lol). The contact links are still there and I even added more so you can find me on more places. </p>
			<p> I also made small design improvements all around the site to make it feel cleaner and nicer to look at. </p>
			<p> Hopefully, the results are good! Also I'm open for criticism or suggestions, just use one of the social links and reach me on there! </p>
