		<h2>03/11/2022 - Using Void Linux as a daily OS + Spotify?</h2>
		</div>
		<div id="content">
			<p> I've been trying various Linux distros for a while but most of the time I had no idea what I was doing, so I decided to give Void another chance. I've been trying to get Gentoo working and had successfully
installed it but I just couldn't get Xorg to start and after several weeks of messing around I decided it was too complicated for me. I had been looking at various Window Manager to try since I wanted to customize the OS to my liking and
stopped on CTWM (Claude's Tab Window Manager), it seemed pretty good for what I needed. I installed Void on my Windows machine first, replacing Linux Mint 19.1 that I wasn't using anymore and got to work. I started learning how the OS worked
 and how to do basic things. I got CTWM installed and several other applications that I needed to make the OS actually useful. I will make a new guide and share my findings in greater detail there. </p>
			<p> I took a break and booted up Void on my Power Mac G5 (DC 2.3 GHz, NVIDIA GeForce 6600) and was browsing the repos when I found that it had spotifyd and spotify-tui. I decided to see what they are and it turns out
one is a CLI client that is more like a remote control and doesn't play sound and the other is a daemon that plays the music. Both of them make for a fully functional client. I decided to give it a try. I set both of them up and their configuration files 
(just by following the instructions on the GitHub pages, they were pretty straight forward) and then started both. Now it was the moment to try if they worked... I chose an album, pressed play and.... static. That's all I could hear - very loud static.
I was disappointed but didn't give up because the pattern sometimes changed and I could faintly hear something resembling music. I went to spotifyd's config file and started messing with the settings. Finally I got to a setting called 
"normalisation_pregain = -10". I changed the value and that actually changed the static a little. I tried several and then set it to "-60", I restarted spotifyd and.... it worked! The music was playing nicely. </p>
			<p> I was happy and got Void installed on the 17" PowerBook and there were several problems I had to fix before but it worked there too! I'll be talking about them in more detail in the guide. </p>
