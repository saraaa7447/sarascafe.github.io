		<h2>SongShuffler</h2>
		<h3>Idle clicker browser game where you skip songs on an iPod for points</h3>

			<h3 class="specialtwo"> Introduction </h3>
			<p> Do you like iPods? Can you often just not find the right song in your ever-growing playlist? Then you're gonna love this! Skip songs as you battle your patience and the worn out battery of your iPod in this Cookie Clicker style game all about music. Originally started as a university project, I couldn't leave this game in the dust after the assignment was over. So I continued building on top of it, fixing bugs, adding features and more. Oh and don't let your mood get ruined, because then it's game over to your listening session!</p>
			<h3 class="specialtwo"> How to play </h3>
			<p> The game is hosted on this very website so you can play from anywhere. All you need is an internet connection. Though you can also download the files which are available on GitHub so you can play offline. Basically just spam the next button on the iPod to get points, which you can use to buy upgrades and special effects. Your battery will drain as you skip, reflecting how on a real iPod it drains really fast because it has to keep powering and accessing the HDD. You can recharge it at anytime and when it runs out, it will start recharging automatically. You must wait a moment for it to fill back up. You also have a mood meter - the more you skip the lower it goes. This game has a special twist that if your mood is completely empty you lose. Also if it's above 50% you get a point multiplier. You may also choose to save and load the game at anytime. There is also an autosave function, which if enabled will save your game when you recharge. </p>
